		<h2 id="pr2">Project 2: USPS Postal Social Redesign</h2>
		<section class="questions">
			<h3>Questionnaires</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					What site will you redesign?
					<ul>
						<li>I will be redesigning USPS's Postal Social website. You can visit the site here <a href="http://about.usps.com/news/trainingfolder/postal-social/welcome.htm">Postal Social Site</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					Who visits your site?

					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What do your visitors look for?
					<ul>
						<li>Tips and services offered by USPS. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					Are they able to find it? If not, why?
					<ul>
						<li>The information is easy to find with the organized grouping the current site has. For example, All the tips and services related to military can be found under the military navigation, which breaks down into sub-navigations. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What does the current site do well?
					<ul>
						<li>The current site is organized well.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What does the current site do poorly?
					<ul>
						 <li>The current site is filled with links that break down into more links to give the customer what they are looking for. There is no other structure to it. It's as if the site is an encyclopedia. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What are short-term or long-term goals that need to be considered in the redesign?
					<ul>
						 <li>Short term: The new design should be visually appealing while keeping the same organization. </li>
						 <li>Long term: Increase USPS customer base and customer visit frequency for the site.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					How does the user interface need changing?
					<ul>
						 <li>There are currently three levels to the site right now. The main navigation of groups, sub-navigation for each group, and material in each sub-group. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What is the most important factor of the new site?
					<ul>
						<li>The navigation. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What areas would you improve in the redesign?
					<ul>
						<li>Finding a solution to better navigate through the site without having to click a bunch on links.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What features would you eliminate in the redesign?
					<ul>
						<li>The redundant amount of links.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					What features would you highlight in the redesign?
					<ul>
						<li>Clear navigation with more insight of what is included within each section than just a handful of link.</li>
						<li>Description of Postal Social's purpose</li>
						<li>Social media, if any</li>
						<li>USPS business information (footer area)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
